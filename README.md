# Digital Operations System (DOS)

DOS is a multi-tenant SaaS platform for managing the day-to-day operations of
service businesses — scheduling, staff, clients, invoicing and payments —
launching with cleaning services (residential, commercial, office,
construction cleaning, deep cleaning) and architected to extend to
maintenance, landscaping and general field services.

## Status

**Fase 2 — Base técnica: complete**, awaiting approval to start Fase 3.
This repository currently contains the foundational architecture (database
schema, API contract, authentication, RBAC, monorepo structure, web/mobile
scaffolds, CI) rather than finished product features — the business
modules (clients, jobs, staff, billing) are stubbed on purpose. See
[`docs/technical-log/phase-2.md`](docs/technical-log/phase-2.md) for the
full build log and [`docs/architecture/overview.md`](docs/architecture/overview.md)
for the system design.
